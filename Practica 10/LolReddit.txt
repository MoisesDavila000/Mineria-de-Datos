Ten years ago, Faker won his first Worlds at the age of 17
I don't see it mentioned, but I find that fact pretty cool. The GOAT is still going strong 10 years later; he always shows up. WBG will be a strong opponent, but on November 19th, everyone will shout for T1.

T1 Fighting!

SPOILER
I finally understand why Gumayusi picked Jhin in game 1 vs JDG.

Ver spoiler
-First of all, T1 won against JDG in 4 games in the semifinals( the rounds where there are 4 teams). Guma also said he would crush Ruler. and which game did he show that? That's right, game 4.

-So let's look at game 4 a bit more. What champions did T1 picked? Yone, Azir and Bard(which was also picked with Jhin in game 1) all had 4 letters in the names. And the jungler? Jarvan the FOURTH. And who did Guma lane against? Zeri and Lulu, also 4 letters. And Guma played Varus, which may seem to break the pattern. But Varus is a Darkin, and how many Darkin in game are there? 4.

-In the outplay to get the dragon soul(4th dragon), who did he kill beside Ruler? 369, or 333 when he's bad(and what is 3 plus 1? 4) playing Aatrox, another Darkin.

-After this game, T1 is on a 4 series winning streak. Now they will have to play LPL 4th and final team, who is also seed 4 to get Faker's 4th worlds championship.

This is not a coincidence. Gumayusi(4 syllables, or Guma-4 letters) purposefully leaked the script for everyone to see.

What is the biggest int play this Worlds so far?
Worlds is a place where the best players come to play and memorable great plays such as Faker’s Azir shuffle are made. However, this worlds also had some of the most insane int plays such as Doran’s flash on Aatrox. The question is, which play is the most iconic int that we will remember for years to come?

Trymbi announces he won't be playing in the LEC in 2024 Winter Split
Announced here

Not starting the LEC 2024 Winter Split I am very surprised how this offseason went, we got permission to talk to teams when most teams were already decided. Hence I got told I am a high priority and FNC was happy to continue with me. After going there for Summer, making it to finals and qualifying for worlds, it did make sense to me. This is all very new and surprising news but since the long seasons and non-stop competing in the last years, having a few weeks for myself will do me good, as I have time to get into routines I used to have and failed to do throughout the year. This year gave me a lot of lessons and I will use the time now to grow from them to be back on top of my game. I will take this time to regenerate and prepare for my next team. Thanks fans for all the support. Love Trymbi.

 

Tweet from Trymbi's agent here (Thanks u/Tesgoul)

Incredible player and human. Heavy obstacles and strong dishonesty ends up in a top player having to sit out.

I recommend to change certain rules for Riot moving forward RiotMAXtheX. The LEC is in Germany, and still employer can prevent employees to talk with possible new employers to find a job at the end of a work relationship. We need permission to talk to others, there should be a safety net for talent.

We will use the time in the best way to grow and be prepared for the next step for Adi.

Why dont proplayers use Maokai ult sideways for an instant 5 man root?
Like, I can see that it makes people run away and it is for zone control. But I saw Ruler instantly caught by Faker's shurima shuffle, and the geometry had me thinking

Teams have already perfected standing behind one person in order to address that.

Since Maokai ult is a perpendicular line on top of him, if the enemies line up behind one person to prepare the possibility

Why dont Maokai's flash W, turn sideways, and ult to an instaroot on everyone, then stopwatch

As long as the direction he is facing is the direction where the root would be  instant , with enough practice, he will be like a Rell initiation, no?

Isnt it broken?

Keria talks about his mindset coming into finals; importance of draft in jdg vs t1 series; thanks fans for doing good deeds such as picking up trash to accumulate good karma and helping them win in semis etc
From: Gamer Insider-  Digital Daily Reporter Moon Dae-chan 

Mindset coming into finals this year compared to last year

Keria: “When I advanced to the finals last year, I was excited for a few days because I thought it was an opportunity to win, but not now. I learned a lot last year. I think I need to prepare well for the finals. I entered this tournament with the mindset of having fun, one game at a time. I gave up the idea that he had to win. I played the game like that and it seems to be going really well. 

Keria was confident of victory from the first set of ban pick on jdg vs t1 match day.

Keria: “Because we made a lot of strange picks , I thought the opponent chose the red side first to deal with this. 

He also explained that the 4th set, which decided the series, was also decided in the ban pick. Keria heavily emphasized the importance of ban pick in the series.

Keria:  Kanavi is good at fighting but it's hard to do anything without a sub-initiator like 369 or Missing. I thought I could win if I just kept Kanavi in mind and didn't give away Rakan 

JDG Kalista-Senna in the losing game was an expected pick. JDG prepared a similar composition to the second game in the third game. T1 was on the verge of losing the third game but had a comeback with faker.

Keria didnt feel any pressure being the only lck team vs 4 lpl teams

Keria: “Even if we fell in the quarterfinals, what can we do when other LCK teams also fell? I didn’t really think about eliminating all LPL teams. 

Impression about WBG + Key players in matchup is zeus and keria vs crisp and theshy

Keria: “I thought Weibo was nothing special at the beginning of Worlds, but I think the performance is gradually improving. I think we have to be cautious as the meta is following along very well. The meta we created has become the mainstream of competition. Everyone is perplexed as to why it happened like that, but if that kind of structure appears in the finals, I think we will have an advantage because we have polished ourselves sufficiently. The key is for ‘Zeus’ and ‘Keria’ to block TheShy and Crisp well.

Keria thanks fans

Keria: “I think team members and fans share a common destiny. I believe that if we all work together, it will come true. Just as we are desperate, our fans are also desperate and feel grateful. I was able to defeat JDG because our fans did a lot of good deeds (context- many t1 fans have been doing stuff like picking up trash on the streets, making donations, donating blood to accumulate good karma ) behind the scenes . 

Final thoughts

Keria: “Last year was my first experience playing the World Cup finals, so I went into it in a very unstable state. However, as we have accumulated a lot of data and experience, we can approach this time with a more mature attitude. I believe I can do well. Rather than thinking about necessarily winning, I will enjoy playing the final.

google translated

Edit- Correction done in line-'Kanavi is good at fighting but it's hard to do anything without a sub-initiator like 369 or missing(thanks to u/long-money).

Edit2- Typo correction that doesn't change meaning

Fun Fact: Faker has never lost a worlds final that he won
If we look through the vast historical records of Faker attending worlds finals, we can see a very interesting trend begin to emerge: Whenever Faker wins the finals, he failed to lose.

2013: SK Telecom T1 vs Royal Club - Faker did not lose the series, so he won.

2015: SK Telecom T1 vs KOO Tigers - Faker did not lose the series, so he won.

2016: SK Telecom T1 vs Samsung Galaxy - Faker did not lose the series, so he won.

2017: SK Telecom T1 vs Samsung Galaxy - Faker did lose the series, so he did not won.

2022: T1 vs DRX - Faker did lose the series, so he did not win.

Whenever Faker doesn’t lose the series, he wins. However, when he does lose, he does not win.

So it seems like as long as Faker doesn’t lose the final series versus WBG, he will win.

The prestige of the ranked climb is completely undermined by having new accounts starting at plat/emerald.
When I first started playing in season 3, I knew my first season that I'd be in bronze. I was bad. I accepted that. Through placements I tried my best and with considerable effort for me back then, I ended my first season in silver.

Next time, I wanted to get to gold. I wanted to claim that I was good enough to get a victorious skin. For the next several seasons I played to win but didn't really know how and as a result I struggled to get through silver and was overjoyed when I first reached Gold and got my hands on Victorious Maokai.

The same thing for a few more seasons and I eventually decided to start trying to climb and reached my goal of Plat.

This season, seeing emerald, I put it as my goal and worked hard to better many of the mistakes that I had in my gameplay and worked my way up the ranks to hit emerald and it felt great.

That was until I started to realize that so many of the team mates I ended up with are fresh accounts to ranked. Not even accounts that have lucked into a win on their first placement, I'm talking accounts with literally nothing but beginner bots to their name.

For how much emphasis Riot puts on their E-Sport, for how much they push for the competitive integrity of their game with constant patches and clash and the promotion of it in the client, Ranked is obviously the primary focus of the game.

What is the point of trying to climb through ranks when buying a botted account it's so clearly the definitive way to reach your desired rank? Diamond and elite players aren't deterred by the prospect of having to play through 50+ games just to get to their rank again so they can happily sink a few dollars on a new account if they get banned, lower players have almost nothing to really strive for and the rewards that used to incentivize so much of the player base they just get anyway.

I've got many friends who were hardstuck silver and were putting in all their effort to climb and then bought new accounts to try and see what it was like only to end up with hollow victories.

What  easy  or simple champion do you still struggle with to this day?
Is there a champion you just can't seem to grasp or understand despite them being relatively easy/stereotyped in the community as simple?

for me it's Hecarim and Garen. I genuinely have no idea what Hecarim ganks do, even at triple Q stacks it feels like he does no damage, and yes the E pushes but you have to use your E to get to them in the first place, so half the time you at best push them into a wall instead of your team, and he also goes in a lot for how squishy he is, especially with assassin builds

as for garen, i just don't understand how my E is supposed to outdamage whatever the enemy does during an all out, even if i silence them first they always have more ways to deal damage (although I do play him Jg so that could be the problem, lol)

Darshan officially retires from League
Announced here

A decade of league and what's next...

Thank you to everyone I had the pleasure of interacting with in eSports. Whether you were a fan, coach, teammate, manager, or even just in the scene, you all had a meaningful impact on my life. These memories will live on forever in my heart. I feel moved to find the ways in which I can give back to this community.

I hope you can support me in the next chapter of my life.

Sad day for the League vets.

Real ones remember this classic.  Even his teacher calls him ZionSpartan 

The early days of him on Good Game University and Team Coast were peak League.

I hope Darshan finds success in whatever he decides to do after this chapter in his life.

 ANALYSIS  Unnoticed anti-hero: How Ruler's  recall shopping  costs JDG game 3, and potentially entire series
Sunday's Semifinals between T1 and JDG gifted us a lot of flashy moments, highlights and topics for discussions. While people correctly discuss missed knight's shockwave or Kanavi solo dying to Faker's Azir in dragon pit, I find interesting that one particularly ugly play from Ruler, which costs JDG game 3, was completely unnoticed by most of the community. Even Chinese fans, during their votes for JDG players, put almost 9 from 10 on Ruler despite a loss and  Faker what was that  engagement.

The motivation of this post is not to flame Ruler or say that other JDG players didn't do mistakes, but rather to empathize, that modern League of Legends is cruel to even smallest missteps and one single death can cost you all. Let's dive in!

Pre-face
Before explaining how Ruler ruined his team's life, let me touch on my logic and thinking process.

As for me, JDG is a team which likes to play around 2-items powerspike. I did some research before series, and found that most of time JDG stay even or at slight lead till the moment when Ruler reaches 2 items and only then they push the accelerator. JDG tries to time it before 20-minute to combine with Baron setup. Around 20:00 Ruler grabs 2nd item and having an item advantage set midlane priority. MISSING, Kanavi and knight pushes top-side of the map, destroy top-side tier-1 tower (if it is not yet destroyed), set vision and wait for knight and Kanavi to complete their items too, to initiate a Baron or fight at their terms.

Here the example for game 2 of the same series. JDG won a fight around 3rd dragon, but didn't  press the button , try to force Baron or anything like this, because they had no second item:

https://preview.redd.it/analysis-unnoticed-anti-hero-how-rulers-recall-shopping-v0-rzc0qjoynb0c1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=29c4e712ddc1454c344b0da5a3409cf7835bff30
Instead, JDG prefered to take down midlane tier-1 tower and to secure a dragon to prevent T1 from soul point. After that fight, both Kanavi and Ruler got their 2nd items, and they immediately transitioned to top-side and started pressuring T1. Constant deep vision, priority at midlane and toplane, they control entire topside of the map and constantly force T1 to check Baron pit every 5 seconds and face-check dark map:

https://preview.redd.it/analysis-unnoticed-anti-hero-how-rulers-recall-shopping-v0-uqndlk6dob0c1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=364d5b01cc941b4b8ee038493a50cadd70768fb4
JDG knows that they have a decent items advantage, but T1 did their best to hold relatively well, until in 60 seconds after the screenshot I posted above at 24:25, T1 in desperation tried to engage on JDG and get completely outclassed in team fight, which JDG transitioned to Baron and winning a game. JDG magic works perfectly in game 2, they squeeze their item advantage to maximum and force T1 to make a mistake.

Actual play
Now, with game 2 in mind, let's turn back to Game 3, 19:50 on the clock. T1 are formally ahead in kills and at the soul point, but JDG, unlike game 1 and like game 2, are more than happy to take this trade:

https://preview.redd.it/analysis-unnoticed-anti-hero-how-rulers-recall-shopping-v0-idsn3z70mb0c1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=fddb982a6b4bf1cf2526e76cef06f5a12a699c36
Why JDG are happy despite the formal  bad game state  from a neutral viewer perspective?

Because they are ahead at tempo.

T1 were just forced to recall, but actually none of their players managed to grab 2nd item. Because of bad recall timers, they are heavily bleeding on the map. Knight just pushed tier-1 tower at the toplane, 369 set a slowpushing wave at toplane, and Zeus must answer it, Ruler has a priority on midlane. More to this, Ruler is ahead of everyone in items tempo thanks to cheaper lethality build and cs difference with Gumayusi. After clearing the next wave, which you see on the screen, he will have enough for his 2nd item — Manamune.

Following the JDG masterplan, I have little doubts that their thought process was the next: Ruler buys 2nd item and returns to midlane. Having an item advantage, he can easily set a prio and we will try to break midlane T1 tower, and start setting deep vision in enemy jungle, thanks to Knight who just secure a tower at the toplane and is pretty close to his 2nd item. Our goal is to stay ahead in tempo, get 2nd item for Knight, Kanavi and 369, and force a Baron, same as we did in a lot of our previous games like BDS, LNG, BLG, KT.

Ruler happily clears the wave and start recalling having in mind his 2nd item and next steps ... But then ...

https://preview.redd.it/dlm2i8xtrb0c1.jpg?vthumb=1&s=4069a4ec5821a0c6844c65d6ba55be59dd527739
Completely not expecting to see Aatrox punching you into your face, Ruler just solo died to Zeus ... 4 seconds after Baron was spawned!

Kanavi tried to safe Ruler, and used his ultimate, but ended up being caught, chunked to 10% HP and had little chances to contest Baron. From this single play T1 claimed Nashor, killed Kanavi in Nashor pit and entire play would turn into a complete disaster, but T1 got too excited, tried to kill 369 and got caught by respawned Ruler (who bought his 2nd item while T1 yet to back to base), dying in 3 and leaving Baron baff only on Faker and Gumayusi.

Inverse logic
Some people think it was not that big mistake, and they have a good rationale just at the surface: at the end, T1 didn't use this Baron at all, it was only like 900 gold Baron powerplay, T1 didn't break a base and even managed to lose a fight for Dragon soul, delaying game. In 5 minutes later, they traded with JDG soul for 2nd Baron, JDG with empowered minions started to push and was close to win until flashy Faker engage on Azir.

But I have here an inverse logic: if T1 even after a won fight and with Baron did so little, can you imagine how bad it would be without that kill and transition to Baron? T1 basically ruined entire JDG plan, break their tempo, delayed game by 5 more minutes, buying time for Aatrox and Faker to scale to 3 items. JDG was forced to choose next Baron over dragon soul for T1, they were no longer ahead in tempo and no longer in driving seat as they were at 19:55.

Just in single pair of hands, with a very weird recall shopping Ruler threw away entire JDG game plan and ruined his game for a team. After T1 pulled that victory (in any other universe, without this mistake I am more-less confident, JDG would win and go 2:1), the series became way harder for JDG and maybe nervous and pressure led to a shaky game 4 draft and series loss.

Losing one series does not mean a team was bad.
Just want to point this out because the wind blowing on the narratives is getting a little out of control.

“Knight is bad at international tournaments. : just looking at this year in totality, and worlds 2022, this is not even remotely true. People keep forcing this Chovy narrative, but Knight played fucking insane really all of this worlds, the only games I thought he was playing poor was game 2 and 4. He consistently was winning JDG team fights they probably should not have won. I’ve seen literally dozens of people say he got gapped by Bdd, which makes no sense to me because it was Knight’s Neeko doing 4 man ults and tping into good positions. He played really well this year in totality, and he’s literally ONLY gotten better year after year.

“JDG are the most overrated team of all time. : Going into the tournament they absolutely looked like the best team. But as the meta shaked out in the tournament carry tops became more and more important, and ADC became focused around either supportive ADCs, or cheese lanes to shutdown Kalista, very obviously not to JDGs strengths that have made them so dominant at MSI. They found some answers, but this really speaks to why MSI and Worlds are so drastically different, the meta changes this year were hilariously diametrically opposed, I might want to say since Juggernaut worlds. The way professional was played the first half the year vs the last half was just not in the same stratosphere. Anyone who watched LPL could tell you that JDG going into this tournament didn’t look unbeatable, they’re were literally brought to the fucking BRINK by LNG. It was an incredibly close LPL playoffs.

T1 vs WBG is basically D flash vs F flash
As you can see, all WBG has flashes on D while T1 players have flashes on F.

Can faker prove that F flash is superior to D flash?

13.23 Patch Preview
 13.23 Preview!

Turret Gold: We’re making some changes to inner and inhibitor tower gold to give a higher share of the gold as local gold. Given snowballing is at one of the lowest levels right now, we think this will help put it in a more correct spot, while favoring roles like top lane that spend more time in the side lanes.

Janna: Our changes last patch were directionally accurate, but she landed a little underpowered

Riven: As we were chatting about yesterday, we think Riven is a bit weak. Buffing her up a little, while keeping the door open for more long term directional work

Trundle: Trundle has been out of the meta for a while. These buffs are targeted at also bringing back trundle top who we think is a counter to tanks that should be viable in some capacity

Velkoz: he's looking a little weak in both supp and mid, so we're throwing him a bone

Briar: As briar continues to grow in the learning curve, we're tapping her down accordingly. Her growth patch over patch is slowing down however.

K'Sante: Ksante is too strong, we're targeting specifically his level 6 power spike, but we're happy directionally with how the reshape went, he's just OP

Naafiri: Naafiri is overpowered, especially in regular play so we're tapping her down a bit

Nocturne: we're actually not nerfing nocturne, but nerfing Jarvan instead 😅 he's been a bit strong for quite a while even with the previous nerf, so we're nerfing him again  - https://twitter.com/RiotPhroxzon/status/1724281626761515259

PBE CHANGES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE
>>> Champion Buffs <<<
Janna
Riven
Trundle
Vel'Koz
>>> Champion Nerfs <<<
Briar
Jarvan IV
Note above notes, Nocturne is not getting nerfed, Jarvan is.

K'Sante
Naafiri
Ziggs
>>> System Adjustments <<<
Turret Gold - PBE
Mid Inner Turret gold adjusted 300 local + 50 global >>> 425 local + 25 global

Bot/Top Inner Turret gold adjusted 550 local + 50 global >>> 675 local + 25 global

Inhibitor Turret gold adjusted 50 local + 50 global >>> 375 local + 25 global

another long insufferable days before the finals but also sad that WORLDS will be coming to an end, so how about a discussion about your favorite ending lines from a lolesports match.

I really love game series ending lines that really adds up to the story of the match. Some of the most memorable for me are quickshot's ending line from 2016 worlds finals SKT vs SSG game5 which I think is so iconic that I bet you are hearing it right now. another one is Phreak's ending line from 2017 worlds finals SKT vs SSG game 5. Another are quickshot lines from 2019 MSI G2 VS SKT and Drakos lines from the 2019 worlds semis SKT vs G2

This year Worlds has really good ending line in my opinion which are

Medic BLG VS GENG:  and We were told was Busan is the church of chovy! but WHAT'S A GOD TO FIVE NON-BELIEVERS 

Drakos T1 vs LNG: And even as every LCK team falls away, Faker stays standing! T1 stays standing! The last light of the LCK burns bright in Busan! 

Drakos T1 vs JDG:  JDG's hope dwindling, They've taken down BLG, they've taken down LNG. It is not LPL vs LCK! It is T1 vs LPL! and they like those odds! 

but for me the best ending line in terms of narrative and lines that really looks like straight out of poetry is last year worlds DRX vs GENG drakos ending line:

 The last dance goes on! the stage is set! it is one final chapter! and is one more page in the legacy of deft! HE HAS ONE CHANCE TO KILL THE KING! AND TODAY HE DID NOT MISSED!

Azir's pickrate skyrocketed after Faker's performance in JDG vs T1 causing Azir's winrate to plummet
I think Azir is the champion whose playrate is the most affected by pro play, the same thing happened last year in Worlds 2022 where his pickrate kept rising as Worlds was being played, this worlds is no different as Azir's presence was gradually increasing until it exploded after the JDG vs T1 series, this ultimately caused a big WR drop to Azir as hes kinda a hard champ

Heres Azir's playrate by Region:

Worldwide:  Yellow line is all ranks combined

-so who started picking up Azir?

Emerald players no matter their regions are all picking up Azir and playing him en masse followed by Diamond, Plat, Gold, Silver players

-Will Azir keep this staggering amount of playrate? most likely no, within a day or two, Azir's pickrate should fall down a bit after this crazy spike. The Hype won't be able to sustain the lp losses

-To make a comparison, Azir's game count in the day of JDG vs T1 series was similar to busted K'Sante's game count right after his buffs  before he got hotfix nerfed :

Azir  12 November : 55k games vs KSante  25 October  : 59k games , KSante got hotfixed on 26 October

-One last fun fact: While HoB Azir hasn't won much in pro play  Faker alone has the only HoB Azir win in Worlds , HoB Azir is winning much more than Conqueror or Lethal Tempo Azir in SoloQ

According to Chinese viewership numbers, Weibo is actually the most popular team in the LPL, and by a decent margin. Here's hoping the finals next week smashes viewership records!
https://imgur.com/a/miUDhvQ

Viewership from Spring 2023 regular season, in 10,000s. Not sure what the actual stat is measuring (19,539,000 average viewers sounds insane, but maybe?), and not sure how accurate this data actually is, but still interesting!

Queueing jungle in quickplay should automatically force you to have smite
Just had a game where someone forgot smite in quickplay and we couldn't do anything the entire game. Suggestion: make smite, when queueing jungle, mandatory, unless you are in a 5 man group. This allows people who are 5-man to try different stuff, while also making it so that you don't get people who just forgot to pick smite.

LCK caster KangQui's analysis of T1 vs LNG's Pick and Ban translation 

Ver spoiler
LNG vs T1 Pick and Ban analysis by Kangqui translated by me

https://youtu.be/RkldPz8KAwU?si=UEWA60Rnwm2cy8GC&t=712

Friendship ended with Cloudtemplar now Kangqui is my best friend

(Cloudtemplar's video is way too long for me to translate even though I still love him)

I'm translating T1 vs JDG just had to release this first since it was already almost done

We are playing League of Legend and Tarzan is playing God
So thankfully as the last seed of LCK T1 was able to win against LNG. It was a 3:0. Like I said before usually games with Tarzan ended up being MAN vs Tarzan. 9 players are playing League of Legend while Tarzan decided which side win.

 

but like in history of League of Legend when we talk about the central point sometime something else explodes. This series both things happened.

Did Tarzan decide the game? Yes and also No. Did somewhere else also decide the game? Also Yes and also No.

Game 2
So a brief flashback to LNG vs KT we know that Tarzan's Jarvan wasn't great. So why is Jarvan so contested right now? He have insane lane ganking ability, strong engage, and doesn't fall off lategame. He also can fulfill the ad damage role of the team. But in this game you couldn't see any of that here.

Jarvan is a really visual champion on the rift. You should see his presence in the game because he is a champion that can do a lot of things. But Jarvan was invisible this game.

 

Who is good with Jarvan? Oriana. So Oriana is picked away by T1. When BLG picked Jarvan they also always picked Ori with it.

 

So LNG was like ahh Tarzan was just having a bad day that day it should be fine. Of course going into draft having to consider all this and this player's form on a specific champion can be really difficult so I understand. So now people are probably wondering whether Tarzan's form is just not on that day or if he is just really bad at Jarvan. We will find out soon.

 

So LNG first picked Jarvan and tbh the pick/ban isn't too bad. Then T1 responded with Ori and Rell. Then Kaisa which we automatically think Gala. Then Azir is picked into Ori. Although data say Ori is good against Azir but Azir/Jarvan would probably still win. I mean Jarvan are really good at catching Ori so...

 

Anyway Blue's 1-3 pick and Red's 1-2 pick are pretty textbook. Nothing weird is happening here. But then T1 picked Aaatrox third.

 

Toplaner's short Career Life
So Zika's career is short and it is the same case for Bin. I mean Bin have managed to get Rumble but the reason why Top laner's career are relatively short is because there are just too many champions to learn at top. Also the top meta changes way too often. The things you have to learn are too much. The players that have short career often start as a bruiser player so they only play bruisers. In LOL expanding role is harder than you think.

Being able to play a champion is not just a laning issue but also how to position during team fight.

 

But anyway after Scout picked Azir T1 realizes Hey this guy only play bruiser so if we pick Aatrox there is nothing he can do. And also they didn't pick Sej so they couldn't go sej/Jax(of course Jax was also banned). So because of this Aatrox became a really good pick. Unless they have jax/sej they can't deal with Aatrox. this was a really sharp pick.

Second phase of Pick/Ban
So T1 now bans out Kaisa's friend Naut and Alistar. Rell also doesn't like Alistar. Then LNG realize T1 lack damage so they banned out Aphelios and Rakan. Then LNG ask hey are you guys going Senna/Tahm? Because Senna/tahm is a common response to Kaisa. This is because Kaisa's tank support is often countered by Senna/tahm. But if T1 pick Senna/Tahm their dps will go down so LNG is daring them to pick senna/tahm.

 

Then T1 picked Senna and LNG is like  are they stupid?  and picked Blitz that are good aginst senna/tahm. They are feeling really good right now and then well Zika's remaining champion is Gwen. It also pairs well with Jarvan AD. Gwen usually dislike champion that can get in her face like Fiora or Olaf but here only Aatrox can get in range so it wasn't a bad pick. Hahah now we have Gwen how are your tahm going to deal with her?

I think T1 also realize they don't have enough damage. So Nilah was picked to supplement the damage. Of course picking Nilah reduce the safety of the team. Nilah herself isn't really a safe champion. Nilah isn't the best pick here because Nilah isn't a champion that the other team hates.

 

To be honest, when we are down to 4-5 picks it is hard to pick picks that are perfect. Sometime you just have to do with you have. Here if they pick Tahm here they just auto lose so they instead took a risk on Nilah. So think of reducing a checkmate to just a check. They avoided death here so it's not bad pick/ban for them.

Takeaway Points
Tarzan's uncertain form

Zika's limited champion pool

T1 have deep pool that even at 4-5th picks they have stuff to play

In Game
So here Tarzan plans to clear his jungle and come break mid. But at level 2 his mid exploded. At level 2 Azir used his flash. So it's Conqueror Azir vs Comet Ori and usually Ori does win early in this matchup. But unsure whether it's the rune setup or something else Scout flashed at level 2 and because of that the mid gap grew bigger.

 

Here Tarzan realize his mid laner is in danger so he quickly pull up his chat

 wtf this mid lane 

 now I can't go mid... it's joe over for mid 

 wtf I was planning to go at level 3 but now I can't go. If I go I die too 

So Tarzan went top. And here Zeus thought he pushed the wave in and Oner definitely thought so too. but it wasn't all the way in so Zeus had to push without bOner but he didn't have protection so he died. Yeahhh that sometime happens. But anyway the main point is mid lane is over.

 

The reason why we(LCK) love Azir and what LCK loves is: Lane priority. We hate giving away lane priority. We hate starting the game with a deficit. The reason we picked Azir is for the lane priority but now it's gone?? Yeah so basically the game is already gone. Many of us after seeing this went and debated whether we should order fried chicken or not. If mid lane is like this the game is over.

 

Also Azir went Conqueorororor this means he want to stay in the fight and stack those yellow pain stacks. So he is going for a more bruiser style. It's a build you cannot be behind. But then Ori got her crown. In fact because the game is going so well Ori doesn't need damage so fuck it we going banshee. Then Blitz is like wtf I can't hook her. Because of this mid lane explosion all other four member have nothing to do. The game is supposed to start with Azir/Jarvan pressuring the map but because this is shut down Senna/nilah and Aatrox have a great time.

 

A solo kill even come out on top with a 2 core item spike.

 

Yeah many people are surprised that the game ended so fast.

 

One regret is that I wanted to see senna/Nilah synergy but because the game ended at mid so we never saw it.

You know how some predator animals would bring prey with their legs already broken for their children to learn to hunt? The game basically ended like that.

What kind of Team is LNG?
So we often think LNG as Tarzan + Scout and especially Scout he is insane. Like 70% of the games are won by Scout. Playoff Scout was so good and maybe even a bit better than Ruler. So I thought maybe he gets better in important games? But here he ruined the game singlehandedly.

 

Then Tarzan self-mute himself and was like wtf why is the blame on me when I am playing normal you know what I am going mid fuck you. So here I get it. Azir went in and realized he wasn't in range so instead decided to push Ori back. It's a mistake but still I can see his intention. Then Jarvan came in and it's like what is your intention with that robot? It's not going to happen. Yeah, Scout messed up but you didn't have to mess up together.

 

But anyway, Jarvan unmuted himself and pulled his chat up:

 I knew we couldn't win after seeing this Azir level 2 

then bot/top lane is like well here goes my LP.

 

This is why people keep fighting in soloQ because they don't know who lost the game. Jarvan know it's Azir but Azir will question ping Jarvan. But anyway the team is like:

 What a boosted Azir  and moved on.

Game 2
Because LNG lost Game 1 they picked Blue side again. Instantly there is a concern. Do blue side have to ban Jarvan? Azir ban is okay because it forced Ori ban. Jarvan ban is a bit...

So LNG si thinking  ¿We played team fight comp last game let's do what we like, KT style?  So they picked Jayce and Maokai. And to be honest Tarzan's form was the best playing Maokai. So yeah fuck meta we ball light cannon/hammer.

 

And because Aatrox is picked they pick Gwen. And it's like it's only 1-3th pick you are already picking Gwen? T1 realize if they pick Aatrox early LNG have no response. This is another LNG's weakpoint.

 

So here Sylas came out and he is good against Maokai and it's not bad against Jayce. It's actually more doable than you think. So Sylas was able to neutralize Maokai's engage since he can just do Simon say.

 

Second Phase of Pick/Ban
So T1 banned out Gala's Kaisa. And LNG decides to ban T1's favorite bot lane strategy: snowball so they banned out Cait. Then Varus came out which is a bit of a surprise. Usually, when Varus come out you don't want to pick Aphelios into it but because Varus' is not that good so LNG maybe thought it is still doable. Also, Aphelios can pressure Aatrox so maybe they thought they're giving Aatrox too much freedom.

To be honest this is a not bad game for Apehlios because all of them are coming in. All Aphelios have to do is grab a random weapon and hit what is in front of him. So to not let Aphelios do whatever he want Ashe came out. But even if Aphel would lose a bit in laning it was still doable for Aphelios.

 

In reality, Maokai's jungle was deforested and also Varus/Ashe was too strong so Maokai had nowhere to go. So even if Tarzan is Kanavi diving bot sounds really hard. So they couldn't do what Kanavi does diving bot. In fact, T1 pinged Maokai doing chickens so they saw it coming. But even though it is a difficult game for Maokai he still did well considering everything.

 

but anyway here we are at fourth drake. So because T1 have a stronger bot lane it is normal for them to take the first few drakes so the question is whether they can take more. So LNG have been powering up for this drake fight and they came well prepared and they have champions that spikes well at 2nd item so it was doable.

So tbh this was a fight that wouldn't be surprising if T1 lost.

 

So aside from Aatrox all members of T1 are scared of Gwen. Especially, the two marksmenwomendarkin hate Gwen. Because Gwen is

Invincible
Because Gwen can decide when to go immune or not so if she uses her W correctly T1's backline can't do anything to her. And Aatrox can go down badly if Aphelios look at him correctly. The mute gaze is powerful but the 4 people 2 bow can't really do the same to Aphelios. AAtrox have to be careful because if Apehelios or Jayce play correctly he can die really easily.

 

but the Rell stun into Aaatrox's Q2 was too beautiful. Basically made Gala look like an idiot. Then Sylas managed to steal.. Rakan's ult? And went Rakan all over the Gwen. Because of this amazing move, the backline of T1 was unlocked.

I think the key moment was when Sylas managed to sneak up to Gwen.

 

So this was a very important fight for LNG and it is very difficult to match the timings for LNG but nevertheless, they lost the fight. This was a game that wouldn't be weird if LNG won.

 

I mean it's not like they had no chance at the last fight either but because Scout used hammer wrong so... Haha does Tarzan have to un-selfmute himself again?

Game 3
Anyway LNG realizes they can't Jarvan so it's banned then it seems they were scared of Rell. Oh maybe they want to break the game open and Rell provide too much safety. Then T1 banned Maokai and the game is already over. This is why pick/ban is so important and you need to respect it. What is Tarzan going to play now?

 

LNG then picked Ori because Ori is good. Then T1 responded with Poppy and Azir. Poppy is really good if you have priority and with Azir you can have that mid priority for Poppy. It seems T1 wanted to do something with the Poppy/Azir duo.

 

Then LNG picked Renetkon and Sejuani. So maybe they thought they gave Aatrox too much freedom so they picked a strong top/jungle duo. But then why don't they just pick Jax? Maybe they were scared of Poppy? If this is TheShy he would still Jax. I feel like if you are picking Sejuani Jax is the better duo.

 

Then T1 picked Reneta to prevent LNG to pick tank support. Then what does Reneta hates playing against? Lux and Karma so they banned Cait and then they still have to respect Gala's Kaisa so it is also banned.

 

Then Because Reneta are good with Kalista so LNG banned Kalista. Then they remember how good Zeus' Gnar is so he is also banned. Then LNG picked up Milo/Aphel. Aphel, Milo, Ori are really good together. With Ori's protection and Milo's buff Apehlios can be really scarry with that range. So T1 decided to pick something with even longer range: Jayce. The problem is that Jayce is really risky most player won't pick him because you might explode too. But T1 picked it despite it going against Renetkon/Sejuani.

 

So here Scout is like hey guy game 1 was just an accident Ori is actually better in this matchup. I can win lane no worry. Then Tarzaned is like I am already deafened. Scout is winning lane hard with a cs advantage then everyone is like wow he isn't boosted?

 

Then Tarzaned went 1v1 against bOner. Tarzan froze her ass and get her low and it looks it is doable. Then Poppy is like  nah I would win  and throw a shield and slammed him against the wall(should have been me) and sent Tarzaned back to loser queue.

 

Ori is pinging Tarzan like crazy

 Hey wtf you said as long I win lane you can carry .

Ori's mental state collapsed and decided to at least secure blue. Ori was like I have lane priority but yeah, the planet is dying, the government hates us, the animals are leaving, the aliens aren't contacting us, WE MIGHT BE ALONE, IT MIGHT JUST BE YOU AND ME, BUT THAT'S OKAY!! BECAUSE DO YOU REALLY NEEED ANYONE ELSE?!?!?

 

Then he see Poppy running away with blue.

Renetkon is leaving.

 

I honestly think Sejuani's mental is gone. It's like he will do something but I rather him not do it. For example, they dived bot but the wave is really thin and they don't have Ori with them.

Conclusion
So it is a bit ridiculous that Tarzan can't play Jarvan. Every team that can't play Jarvan isn't doing well right now. But here is the takeaway points

LNG
Zika's inexperience

Tarzan's uncertain form

Hang something something not sure about him to be honest. Huh his Blitz game wasn't good? Wtf are you supposed to do to Crown Banshee Ori???

T1
T1's top lane pool is big but the bot lane's pool is huge

Usually at 4th-5th pick people run out of stuff to pick but it seem T1 always have something up their sleeve. It is not quite good as the picks in 1-3th picks but it is still not bad. This could be scary for other team. Midlane pool are also solid being able to play both matchups and because he showed Sylas today it might be difficult to pick Maokai into them and to a lesser degree Sejuani.

So Despite being really good in summer Scout and Tarzan is out of this tournament. A bit unfortunate since Scout was really good in the playoff. As for Gala... I didn't even know he played so yeah.

a challenger's perspecitve on league in general, as well as adressing people's common concerns with the game
*these are my opinions, they aren't absolute and should encourage discussion, but it is the equivalent of an NBA player discussing basketball with a high school athlete*

1. The game is not bad.

If you feel like playing is a chore, genuinely ask yourself why you continue to play the game. If your answer is:  because I just always have,  then I think you know what to do. Take a break, come back, and you'll probably love it more than ever. It will always be here.

It was released in 2009 and has only gained in popularity, maintaining its yearly status as one of the most popular games on the planet. Statistics speak for themselves. If you thought a food was bad you wouldn't eat it, but you choose to eat League, which is also why you're morbidly obese.

To some people it may not appeal, it's a competitive multiplayer game, of course! But, if you have 5,000 hours in it don't even start on how it's a bad game...

(TL;DR if playing feels like a chore, ask yourself why you play. The game's popularity and consistency speaks for itself in terms of effectivness as a medium of entertainment)

2. The game is pretty balanced, stop harassing its developers.

(I'll be honest, I fell into this bad habit of permanently complaining about the game's balance as well as criticizing the people in charge of its decisions. But I came to this realization the better I got at the game, and every time I see people complaining a champion is broken on this subreddit, I will proceed to watch the clip or read their rant, and recognize, wow, you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Here's what I realized:)

I've said some pretty questionable things in my life, and acted extremely immaturely, but the amount of harassment I've seen toward Phreak and league developers in general is ridiculous. First of all, if you're in a lower rank, most changes don't even matter with the sheer amount of mistakes being made that just go completely unpunished. For higher-elo players, this frustration makes sense, but never should we ever be legitimately harassing nor insulting them to this degree. It is childish and embarassing to our community. In addition, what makes you think a developer, because they're a, key word, PERSON, will be incentivized to pour their heart into improving the game when its players are constantly harassing them? Particularly when most of you, have no idea what the hell you're talking about!! Yeah, they're being paid to work on it, but they're f***ing people just like you and me.

Firstly, there are 165 champions as of this post's creation. Each champion has 5 abilities (including passive), and there are over 200 items in the game. That means there are 1025  things  in the game, excluding champion interactions which become more complex, that need to be in near perfect balance at all times. League is not a gun game, it's not that simple.

Assuming it is played perfectly, there are champions that are designed to beat you, particularly early game. It's like saying pantheon is overpowered; I check your match history and you were playing kayle and died 5 times before minute 8, and your team surrendered before he reached his weakest point, midgame. He's overpowered because you didn't realize after the first 4 deaths that you can't walk up to farm against a champion that's particularly strong early game. It's the reaction of a toddler doing the same thing over and over again with tears in his eyes, because that's probably exactly what you did: you tried to play League like it was a first person shooter, and it's not.

But foj, there's some champions I can't EVER fight in lane no matter what point in the game I'm in! This took me a while to understand and feel, but lane isn't everything. And, welcome to the importance of understanding the game. Will a Riven ever be able to 1 vs 1 a Renekton? No. I could lose to an Emerald Renekton in a 1 vs 1 at 20 minutes if he has the mental capacity to press QWER. What separates a good and an average player is understanding its design. Hey, I have 4 f**king dashes and build hydra first, meaning I have good wave clear and solid roaming potential; I just need to minimize my losses in lane and gap him in teamfights with my AOE. Because, that is what I am designed to do!! I am designed to be able to roam!! When you say a champion is overpowered, chances are its not. Champions like Garen and Illaoi are overpowered in lane relative to other meta toplaners, but are they overpowered in general? No. These two champions rely directly on their ability to splitpush and bait enemies into falling for it. If you clear the wave and proxy, they become USELESS. They are designed to be strong in lane as there are serious counterplay measures. Lane isn't everything. In addition, perspectives of one tricks on other champions are often heavily biased. Imagine trying to play Illaoi into a syndra, it is unplayable.

But I'm low elo!!  insert champion name  is so broken down here! Oh, look. The developers you so hate are the ones that are even catering to your lack of understanding and providing elo-specific nerfs to things that seem to be strong to you, when in reality, you have no idea what you are doing, and could fix the misconception with a clear mind and an outside perspective. It is the equivalent of complaining about a shotgun in an FPS when you're so close to the enemy you can smell they haven't showered in a few months.

(TL;DR This continual harassment of developers will only further destroy the community's relations with developers, developers' intrinsic motivation to improve the game, and our community's reputation to newer players. There is an unfamothable amount of factors that interact in ways that can't be expected whether it be bugs or overtuned items; league is exponentially harder to balance than an FPS. Understand the roles of champions and that being a better player includes acceptance of certain matchups as unwinnable.)

2. Elo hell and loser's queue do not exist.

I have played in every elo and felt stuck at every elo at one point. There is not a single rank in which the term elo hell applies. These two concepts are attempts to rationalize one's emotional response, often of their own inadequacy. What seems like loser's Q is the work of a team game at play. Due to the nature of a 5 vs 5 match, it is a complex system with the goal being to maximize the probability of success; there have been games I have lost in Silver due to severe unluckiness and champion specific interactions. If you hate it, realize that a Radiant in Valorant with 10,000 hours could get run and gunned by a drunk Iron player out of sheer luck.

(TL;DR elo hell and loser's q are rationalizations of emotional responses to inadequacy. League is a complex system as a team game, you being better than the other players should only increase probability of winning, not guarantee it. Radiant's in Valorant can get rng-ed by a 7-year old by pure luck; if a challenger gets solo-killed by an iron it's time to reconsider the ranking system.)

3. In any competitive setting, there will be unavoidable negative emotion and toxicity.

In any professional sport, and look at any, there will be always be controversy and minor feuds between players in the heat of the moment. This is also worsened by the isolated nature of gaming as well as League being a multiplayer and quite competitive game. Toxicity in League is appears to be more severe than other games because simply put, there are more players and just more of everything.

However, there are issues that specifically come with the nature of gaming. In League, as lots of focused is required, we will generally be playing by ourselves, and as humans are social creatures, this can often have negative side-effects when playing for extended periods of time. It's very easy to project one's issues onto others through the form of toxicity, especially when we forget there are humans just like us on the other end. It is so easy to dissociate consequences from our actions particularly online. I have issues with this myself, I will not pretend I don't, but it's something I work on.

How could we fix EXTREME toxicity? I'm not really sure, nor am I really qualified to speak on this, but I may consider attaching some form of real identity with one's account similar to Korea or China. That way, there is some form of true accountability and real consequences to players actions. Some may say it removes the appeal of playing in the first place (anonymity), but I think that's also the issue.

(TL;DR if toxicity scares you, a competitive game to this degree is not for you. Reactions ike toxicity occur in response to being invested in something you care about; it's seen in professional sports since their invention. League's toxicity seems exacerbated due to the isolated nature of gaming and its anonymous feature.)

4. Anyone can hit challenger, but you must be playing to win rather than simply playing for enjoyment.

But, it takes people years to hit challenger! Yeah, but this is the difference between playing with intent and playing for fun. You will never hit it as a casual unless you're able to play 10 games a day for an eternity. People play for 7 years and remain gold, and others can hit challenger in 2. Time does not necessarily equate to skill, but over time, intentional playing will directly correlate to skill. In addition, in physical sports, coaching is extremely normalized if not just flat-out necessary, in esports it is not as common for individual players or looked down upon (in my opinion).

Simply put, there is no way a casual player will ever outclass a player who is obsessed with the game no matter what rank they may be. A more talented player may beat a less talented player initially, but if the other player has an obsession for perfection, he will eventually become inferior. Obsession can become talent itself. A player who thinks about the game more will not only have more repititions in matches, but will also create a habit of processing situations in the game, and that means more thoughtful repititions. Enough thoughtful repetition will lead to near perfection.

(TL;DR if you want to hit challenger, stop playing as a casual and play a lot of games with a lot of intent. Even if you have barely any talent, obsession can amount for a lack of initial skill.)

JDG vs T1 - Hupu Player Ratings

Ver spoiler
Source: https://imgur.com/a/mIm8gtn

Zeus  9.0/3.8/7.2/9.2 

Game 1

I’ll put on a masterclass today since someone failed to beat Rumble with Aatrox yesterday. My rank - Worlds Quarterfinalist

I am not Bin, and you are not theshy

Game 2

Limited time trial of the theshy experience has ended

Game 3

We don’t blame you, you tried your best to act. Please don’t carry the next game

You’re doing Faker dirty playing like this. Was last year not regretful enough?

Do you think you’re theshy just because you have a centre parting?

Game 4

Why do you think you can let my Yone slip through P/B when even DRX was afraid to?

It’s time to challenge that person at the finals, a challenge for the title of worlds best top laner

Oner  9.1/3.5/9.1/8.9 

Game 1

God of Gamblers Big O: “The micro movements in summer you saw were intentionally added in by me in the 500 earlier rounds. No one can study me through recordings, but I can study every one else through their recordings 

Game 2

LNG Tarzan: I will continue to try to possess him in the next matches

Game 3

5 star General Douglas MacArthur said: I have no idea how JDG is going to win if even big O starts to carry

Game 4

KR needs to stop investigating GDragon and start investigating this punk  T/N: Kpop star GD is currently under investigation for drug charges 

Faker  9.5/4.3/9.7/9.7 

Game 1

Faker prayed to the Gods, the Gods took a look at his ID and did not dare to respond

Yes, the one standing before you is: S3 World Champion, S5 World Champion, S6 World Champion, 2016 MSI Champion, 2017 MSI Champion, 2013 OGN Summer Champion 2014 OGN Winter Champion, 2014 NLB Summer Champion, 2015 LCK Spring Champion, 2015 LCK Summer Champion, 2016 LCK Spring Champion, 2017 LCK Spring Champion, 2019 LCK Spring Champion, 2019 LCK Summer Champion, 2019 Rift Rivals Champion, 2020 LCK Spring Champion, 2022 LCK Spring Champion, S3 Worlds Finals MVP, 2013 OGN Summer MVP, 2013 Korea eSports Award - Best Team and Best Midlaner, 2013-2014 OGN Winter MVP, 2014 LoL All-Stars Champion, 2015 LCK Summer MVP, 2015 Korea eSports Award - Best Team, Best Player and Best Midlaner, S6 Worlds Finals MVP, 2016 Korea eSports Award - Best Team, Best Player and Best Midlaner, 2016 IEM Champion, 2017 The Game Awards - Best eSports Player, 2023 Hangzhou Asian Games - eSports Gold Medallist T1 Faker!!!

Game 2

“The Gods cowered from answering back, but Xiaohu did 

Game 3

I’ve known about you since S4. When EDG defeated you in S5 MSI, I thought it must be over for you that Worlds, but you won back to back World Champions. Watching your anguish in S7, your hands shaking in S9, I thought your era had ended. This series I thought you were going to be defeated by JDG, but you ended the series with the ultimate shurima shuffle. Yes, you are still That Faker. It seems like time did not bring a decline in your skills. Instead, it has taught you that as you grow older, you have to grab every opportunity that comes by. Irregardless of everything else, you are an extremely good LoL pro player.

Game 4

You have many names on the internet. You are Lee Sang Hyeok, Big Brother Lee, Dog Lee, Idiot Lee  T/N: affectionate nickname for Faker by CN fans , Demon King. But in League of Legends, you are the ID that inspires fear, Faker. Showmaker vowed to reinstate LCK’s glory after witnessing your tears, Crown is still living in your shadows from your sorrowful gaze. We say that LOL made players into who they are today, but for the Midlaner who has been competing for 10-ish years, we can only sigh and admit with resignation that you are the one that’s responsible for LCK’s glory. In the midst of all the curses and praise, we all cannot deny that you perfectly embody what a professional gamer should be like, both in and out of games. You are LPL’s first enemy, as well as our last. Today we failed to cross this mountain, perhaps Korea’s dominance still continues, but we will never give up in our attempts to conquer this towering peak. Ten years on, your legend remains the same. The cup that is your badge of honour but also caused you to suffer from stigmatisation is once again within your reach. It does not matter if the final result is the continuation of your legend or the crowning of a new king. I believe, you will never need to pray. “There is no need for me to pray to the Gods, because the Gods are eulogising my name 

Talent, hard work, humility, abstinence from women, eSportsmanship, plus holding the fort at SKT for 10 whole years. If you do not deserve to hold the cup, no one else would.

Gumayusi  9.2/4.0/8.5/9.6 

Game 1

Everybody is asking me how I’ll contain Ruler. Nonsense, I’ll crush him

Game 2

It can’t be helped, a female police officer can’t capture 2 black men

Game 3

The stopwatch usage during the last fight was amazing

Game 4

6 years ago, I sat in front of the TV and witnessed Faker being shot down by Ruler with a single arrow at match point. I will never forget Faker’s tears after missing out on his 4th trophy. Hence I swore to myself, when I become a pro player myself, I will try my best to win every single match. Everyone calls me Little Lv Bu. The first time I battled my way into Worlds Finals, I tried to turn the tides of battle with my Varus. Alas, we did not manage to grab on to that opportunity. This time, I will use my Varus to help Faker win back what was once his.

Keria  9.5/3.5/8.7/9.2 

Game 1

No, but are you trying to destroy the LPL?

Korea Academy of Science and Technology - Academician Ryu Min Seok

Game 2

Even a farmer’s whip is more effective than your auto attacks

Game 3

The only carry support

Game 4

At the end of 2022 World Finals, I saw the defeated Keria on his chair sobbing uncontrollably. It was that moment I had a premonition that he will grow to be an incredibly scary opponent. We often see tears of defeat, but I have never seen such a pure hunger/desire for victory

Today is the one year anniversary of Surrenderat20's last post...
Dang I miss this site. I'm not on Twitter/X and so I don't see the tweets announcing skins and updates, so I've missed skin lines being released and various updates. Having a site like Surrenderat20 that had reliable, updated posts for each League content release/update was amazing. I'm kind of baffled Riot didn't step in to support the site or create their own version of it.

Fun fact: Faker and Xiaohu are second pair of players ever to meet in Worlds Groups, Quarters, Semis, and now Finals.
First one was ... Uzi and Faker, and now RNG legacy comes into play again.

They've met:

2016 Worlds Quarters, Faker won 3:1

2017 Worlds Semis, Faker won 3:2 (famous Galio incident)

2019 Worlds Groups, Faker won 2:0 (RNG didn't make it out of groups)

2022 Worlds Quarters, Faker won 3:0

And now in 2023 they will meet in Worlds Finals, closing the loop.

Poor Xiaohu has lost all of their previous meetings. Same as Uzi btw (they played with Faker 2013 Finals, SKT won 3:0, and then 2016-2019 run was Uzi & Xiaohu against Faker).

But if you think,  lol this guy stands no chance , then I remind you that if we add MSI into equation, then last year at MSI-2022, RNG with Xiaohu won over T1 in Finals 3:2, and played 1:1 in groups. Xiaohu already once tasted a victory over Faker, though it was MSI, but who knows, maybe Spring is delayed this year?

Addition from comments: Faker played against Xiaohu also in Semis of MSI-2016 (Faker won 3:1, and 1:1 was in Group Stage), and by making to Finals this year, they will meet each other at every possible stage of both international tournaments excluding PlayIns

History of World Champs Finals (D-lash vs. F-lash)
Chart

The age-old debate of  Flash-on-D or Flash-on-F  finally can be solved in the most important match of the Season in the World Championship Finals.

As this post highlights, this is the first time a full team-wide D-lash vs. F-lash has happened in the World Finals. So I looked back at the previous World Finals to see which is better: D-lash or F-lash.

Explanation of the chart at the end:

 World Champions (Player totals)  is simply the # of players who have won a World Championship with Flash on D or F.

 World Champions by Flash Majority  looks at the winning World Championship team and if they have more Flashes on D or F.

 World Champs (relative to opp.)  looks at whether or not the winning World Championship team has more Flashes on D or F, relative to their opponent, regardless of whether or not they are a Dlash- or Flash-majority team.

NOTE: Players in grey did not play in the Finals, but did earlier in the tournament. These players are not automatically counted in the table of stats at the end of the chart.

Some fun observations:

This is the first time a full D-lash vs. F-lash matchup has happened in the World Finals. The closest we have come in the past was in 2012, where TPA all had D-lash and Azubu Frost had F-lash (except for MadLife).

A full 10-player sweep almost happened in 2015, but SKT MaRin and KOO KurO had D-lash. This happened again in 2022, when DRX Deft was the only player to have D-lash.

The last 2 Worlds winners (2021 EDG and 2022 DRX) have had more Dlashes than their opponent. In fact, the team with more Dlashes have won 4 out of the last 6 World Finals.

Why was  First Pick  removed from Champ select?
Hey I don't usually make posts here but I'm absolutely flabbergasted right now why did Riot remove first pick? It's how I center my picks/bans around especially my bans. I'm not high elo (D4) but I still really need to know whose first pick so I can decide if I need to ban a counter pick or if I'm safe to first pick my champ. If someone could give me a valid explanation on this it would really help. I was reading the patch notes and couldn't find anything :((

Discussion on how fun the new Enchanters (Renata Glasc and Milio) are to watch in the Pro Scene, compared to the old Enchanters.
Enchanters have historically been frowned upon whenever they appear in Worlds. Specifically, the duo of Lulu and Janna, which later got joined by the nightmare that is Yuumi, have been criticized for causing a inactive game state for a majority of the time. In fact, Phreak has openly admitted to try to make a majority of the pro support meta engage supports because he believes that a majority of the audience thinks they're more fun to watch.

With this Worlds, the metagame has shifted from a classic proplay engage support meta to an enchanter/tank support meta mix to an enchanter/adc meta mix...and also the occasional Lux and Bard. What I'm curious about is how fun it is for others to watch the new age enchanters: Milio and Renata Glasc. Both of whom specialize in disengage, anti-dive, and defense, with Ms. Glasc being more capable of engage. Are they more fun to watch than Lulu/Janna? Or are the same old boring enchanters?

(Note: I am biased to like enchanters even to watch during esports, so I'd love to see other people's opinions on this)

Briar hard or easy?
Emerald opinion, tw(?)

Briar's difficulty is still confusing for me even though it's not as complex as some champs or unique.It's hard to tell because she feels like you need good decision making to play her but it ends up just being they enemy team's decision making in teamfights other than looking for positions and enemy skills.Her W do need some skill but it feels like more extreme fiddle ult type of skill. When I W, it ends up them dead or me dead, when briar's concept revolve around her W. Sometimes I sluggishly throw W and get kill or use it on the right timing and get vaporized a lot.Dunno about y'all but Atleast I can't expect the next 5 seconds of entire enemy team. It's High risk high reward except that it's just entirely comp or situation based that you don't really have control of. But her R and E needs a lot of macro too. she feels like the better the macro the better the champ, and micro on her barely matters. Easy but weird

Fun Fact - All of T1's current coaching staff have been players on T1
Tom was a jungler, Roach was a jungler, and Sky was a mid sub. Having players in the coaching positions feels like it attributes some sort of success. NRG being another example, with them having multiple retired or ex-players on coaching staff. Playing the game versus strictly being a coach analytically is very different. Akin to avid football or American football fan. A father coaching their child's sport match because they've been in their position is vastly different from a person who only watches the sport.

edit. Roach was top laner not jungler.

Would you trust Faker to play akali into orianna?
If WBG get orianna and azir is banned, would you trust Faker to play the akali into orianna matchup? Faker has been playing well at worlds, but several top midlaners have lost on akali such as chovy, knight, yagao, as akali seems like a champ that requires you to play close to perfect. Faker's akali also wasnt too hot last worlds finals. How do you think Xiaohu orianna vs Faker akali would go and do you think he should pick another champ into orianna?

Why is not being able to see Flash VFX anymore not been fixed?
The Flash VFX has been removed for patches, I thought this was a bug, but it's been like this for patches. Has Riot decided to remove the flash VFX to promote  outplays  or what?

Why was flash vfx removed when flashing into fog of war? : leagueoflegends (reddit.com)

I found this post talking about it as well. It's been like this for 5 months and if people flash in Fog you can't see the flash VFX.

Arena Rank should not prohibit you from playing with friends.
Once I hit Gladiator rank, I soon realized I no longer wanted it. I routinely play this game with 4 people, sometimes we have a 5th and swap out. We all love this gamemode despite some of it's obvious flaws.

That being said, Once I hit gladiator, I was met with a message that I could now only queue up with either a duo, or a full 8 stack, or obviously solo. I have since made a new PBE account just to be able to play with all my friends. Why oh why did you do this RIOT? I don't play with a crazy over the top gamemode where I can just afk stand next to someone and come 1st place as a tank, for some sweet sweet rank, I play because its funny as hell, and now even funnier I can do it to my friends. All this is going to promote is people to start throwing games to stay below the bracket so they can play with friends still.

I get why it's a thing, but if you want to do it this way, at the least you could make a separate mode that is unranked and isn't restrictive on the amount of people you can play with once you hit a certain point.

Being locked into sidelanes because the enemy top built hullbreaker is not fun.
So I've been trying my hand at top lane recently, mostly to get a better idea at how I can play around the lane as a support/jungle and I've just gotta say... splitpusher *suck* to play against. Like, I've known this for ages, and I've disliked splitpushers for ages, but after REALLY sinking some time into top lane, yeah this shit is awful.

I play league because it is a team based game, I want to engage in the team aespect of it, I want to teamfight. It feels like the second someone decides to play Fiora, Garen, or god forbid SION I am literally not allowed to leave sidelanes because if I do the enemy gets at minimum one turret.

I think the idea of dedicated splitpushers in general is a kinda problematic concept for champion design, especially evident by most DEDICATED splitpushers being AWFUL in high elo (see yorick) while those who can choose between splitting and fighitng still being pretty okay to very strong.

Splitting should be an opportunistic choice made when it is advantageous for you/your team, not a minute zero decision.

Random thought
In my humble opinion, the best thing about LOL is the stuff that isn't the game. The music and Arcane are some of my favorite pieces of media but I can't stand one round of League. Anyone else feel this way?

PSA: don’t rank up in arena if you want to play with friends.
Apparently if you get to gladiator in arena you lose your chance to play with 3 or 4 people, and are locked just to 1, 2, Or 8 (unranked game). I don’t mind being forced to play ranked except for when I get punished for doing good.

Including this years World’s Tournament
Faker and T1 have

1st place finishes: 3 (possibly 4)

2nd place finishes: 2 (possibly 3)

Top 4 finishes: 2

Years not in attendance since team’s formation: 3

T1 have been an organization since 2013 and Have only not qualified for worlds 3 times. That’s 3 out of 11 worlds tournaments if you include this years. So they’ve attended 8 worlds tournaments. Have won 3 of them, placed 2nd in two of them, and placed top 4 in two of them. And now this year they will once again either have their 3rd second place finish or have their 4th worlds title.

That would be a 50% win rate of the worlds tournament as a whole. 4 worlds titles out of 8 worlds appearances and the other 4 appearances are split between top 4 finishes and being runner up.

I have to say it…Faker is literally insane. He is THE greatest GOAT. He is the GOAT of GOATS. He’s the mother fuckin GOAG! 8 out of his 11 years playing this game, he has taken his team to be at minimum one of the top 4 teams in the world.

Castors always love to talk about the “longevity  of his career or other player’s careers, but to me it’s not that after so long he is still one of the greatest players in the world. Yea whoop dee do. What’s more impressive is that he has been playing this game at this level for over 10 years. Most people can’t last a month playing this game every day and they aren’t even playing it at the top skill level nor for 8+ hours a day! It’s more impressive to me that he is mentally still with it and unphased than it is that he is still good at the game.

Lead Gameplay Designer RiotPhroxzon on the Riven Discussion
Just wanted to weigh in on the Riven conversations that have been happening recently. We've also had some conversations about this in past and recently amongst the Dev team, so I'm representing a combination of theirs + my thoughts. Riven is certainly at one of the lower play rates she's had for a long time, there's a few reasons for this.

Back in early seasons, Riven was one of the few high agency champions. 10 years later, we've released a lot more champions that fill some of those same flashy motivations, which is overall a good thing, but does result in a decline in popularity

It's valuable that we have champions with high skill cap in the game. Not every champion needs to be easy to play and we want to have a mix of simple champions and high mastery ones that are worth investing in. Simplifying every champ in the game is not something we're interested in. Champions with hard inputs is a legitimate player desire that's worth supporting (fits some fighting game player motivations) so long as there are some simple Champs to balance that out.

Is fast Q something that we would intentionally ship on a champion today? No it wouldn't pass the bar, because it's too much input complexity for a non transformative output. If a player is putting a lot of effort into their inputs, we'd probably want that to be rewarded with something a bit more tangible and satisfying, rather than faster autos/Qs. But at this point, Riven mains have invested so much into this mechanic that it would be a disservice to them get rid of it. I don't think anyone is signing up to play riven right now thinking she's an easy champion that's simple to master.

The future

Having said that, Riven does have some legitimate problems. Firstly she's a bit weak. Given that items are changing in Preseason, there's not too much benefit to changing her now though... I see a lot of posts that reference winrate sites like lolalytics blindly. Please look at this to make sure the calculation is correct https://twitter.com/riotphroxzon/status/1683675824883646465

Do we reward Riven appropriately for her mastery investment? Maybe, maybe not. For a champion that is one tricked a lot, her matchups are quite feast or famine. For example, there's lots of champions like renekton that feel like getting your teeth kicked in. She's also a lot more one dimensional than she used to be.

There's probably some good work to be done here that retains her mastery points, but gives her a clear game purpose. You play Renekton to dominate early mid and try to carry that through to a win, but you play Riven to do what exactly? She used to be a decent midgame spiking champ that could snowball and run over the game, but now there's many Champs that do that better than her. It's not clear what her strategic identity is meant to be...

I'd be curious on thoughts

Fun Fact: LCK always win whenever Peanut attends World.
With the T1 vs WBG match coming up I did a fun research and found out every year that Peanut took part in, a LCK team wins World.

2016 - ROX - SKT wins

2017 - SKT - SSG wins

2018 - Home - IG wins

2019 - Home - FPX wins

2020 - LGD - DWG wins

2021 - Home - EDG wins

2022 - GENG - DRX wins

2023 - GENG - T1 goes to the final and….

Agent Peanut deserves that army exemption.

 REPOST  Faker, A Decade of Dominance
Faker is, without a doubt, the Greatest League of Legends player of all time. He sits in rarefied air amongst not only his contemporaries in League of Legends pro players, but stands among the greatest eSports players in South Korean history.

He is League of Legends' ONE AND ONLY BONJWA (본좌) , a title that has only ever been bestowed upon the most decorated eSports players in Korea. There are 6 bonjwas in total, 5 of them were StarCraft players from the Broodwar Era:

Lim Yo Hwan, aka  SlayerS_BoxeR 
Lee Yoon Yeol, aka  NaDa 
Choi Yun Sung, aka  iloveoov 
Ma Jae Yoon, aka  sAviOr 
Lee Young Ho, aka  Flash 

and then there is Faker. He has sat on the  bonjwa chair  in 2013-2014, and has the honor of sitting on the very same chair at the 2017 OGN LCK Finals in front of a live audience, the first to do so.

The concept of a  본좌  in Korean eSports has been defined as  A player who has displayed an otherwordly level of dominant play over a long period of time.  And, as we have witnessed in his latest international showing, Faker has been the dominant force of League of Legends eSports since his debut in 2013 with SKT T1 K as a 17-year old SoloQ phenom. He has carved out a decade-long career, winning titles and breaking records along the way.

Here are some of his notable achievements:

Faker has attended 14 of the 18 premier international League of Legends tournaments that have been held.

8 Worlds Appearances - 3 Championships, 2 Runner-ups, and 3 Final Four Finishes.

He is 93W - 34L, a 73.2% win rate at Worlds, and is also 8/8 as a Final Four participant at the event.

6 MSI Appearances - 2 Championships, 2 Runner-ups, and 2 Final Four Finishes.

He is 70W - 33L, a 67.9% win rate at MSI, and is 6/6 as a Final Four participant at the event.

He has also appeared in 23 LCK tournaments, and holds the record of most championships with 10 LCK Titles and 5 Runner-ups, in what is considered either the strongest or the second strongest region in the world.

He is also firmly in first place in most, if not all the longevity records:

In 10 years, he has a collective 1,105 Games Played in pro play, with a staggering 746 wins to only 359 losses, a 67.5% winrate

He also holds the record for most unique champions played in pro play, a record 74 Unique Champions Played as a mid laner for T1.

According to his gol.gg profile

His Top 3 Most Played Champions are:

Champion	Games Played	Win Rate	KDA
Azir	150	68%	3.9
Ryze	67	64.2%	4.0
Orianna	59	66.1%	4.3
His Highest Winrate Champions (minimum 40 Games Played) are:

Champion	Games Played	Win Rate	KDA
LeBlanc	55	81.8%	5.8
Lissandra	44	79.5%	4.2
Viktor	45	75.6%	4.0
Faker has defined MULTIPLE ERAS of League of Legends. From 2013 to the present day, he has been at the forefront of Korean Dominance in Summoner's Rift. He has pioneered metas and engineered the war machine that is SKT T1 / T1. He is the most popular eSports player in South Korea.

In the same vein as the bonjwas before him, Lee  Faker  Sang-hyeok has been the rock of the modern eSports industry, a face of an entire game/eSport, and has done so LONGER THAN ANYONE IN THE HISTORY OF THE GAME.

Greatness. Personified.

Narratives and Adversities - Worlds 2023 Finals
Ngl I have not watched LPL teams and WBG other than this Worlds and MSI. But I've been a diehard T1 fan since January 2015, when Faker had his struggles, and getting subbed for Easyhoon, I can attest to what they have went through this 2023 season. Here are some struggles that they went through before reaching Worlds 2023 Finals:

Losing Spring 23 Finals

Losing to JDG Upper Bracket at MSI

Losing to BLG Lower Bracket at MSI

Meta away shift from AD Support at the end of Spring split

Faker injury

Whole team struggled without Faker

Lost to DRX 0-2 after Faker injury

Bengi resigns after

Tom takes over

Start 6-2, Fall to 7-9 without Faker

Lose Summer 23 Finals

Just wanted to reflect back on T1's struggles and how they overcame this to reach the Worlds 2023 Finals. Thinking back on all this, this season has been the most special to me. Truly is the grind. The glory.

WBG fans, what were some of their struggles and adversities?

If the winner of T1 vs JDG wins worlds, next year's worlds music video will be insane

Ver spoiler
SPOILERS

Imagine Faker's story continuing from last year as he takes down all of the LPL one after another. We even have insane plays that can be featured like Faker's shuffle or Guma's 1v2 or even Oner's engage. I can see them doing a flashback to Ruler's varus ult and then compare it to Faker's shuffle. Thoughts?

What is your T1 vs WBG prediction
I asked the same thing about T1 vs JDG last week. This time, i know nothing about WBG. So please tell me who you think will win, how and under which condition. T1 looked very promising against JDG. My only fear is, that they won't respect WBG and lose for underestimating them. I think, and i say that for knowing nothing about WBG, T1 wins 3-2.

How to deal with Heartsteel + Titanic Katarina?
I feel like Katarina being able to build this way completely negates any and all intended weakness she's supposed to have as what's supposed to be squishy, high mobility assassin that does a lot of damage but dies if you catch her.

But of course, none of us are perfect players, and there are always things we could be doing better. I've looked up how to try and deal with this on Youtube, and nothing, so I'm gonna make this thread here to maybe get some insight on this.

Impact – Patch 13.22
Hi all,

​Data will be for 13.21 -> 13.22.

​Last update (UTC): 2023-11-13 19:59

​EST: 2023-11-13 14:59 / PT: 2023-11-13 11:59

An update on why this is so late and my current situation:

After the recent Phreak (Karthus ult) incident I got really depressed from Reddit and how this all went down. So much hate. It really hit me, as I do have a heavy depression and I am glad when I have some good days. But this one really destroyed my mental for 3 days. Yes, maybe it is a  me -problem, maybe not. But the only solution for me is to step away from the internet and especially Reddit.

Today I was finally ready again to work on my project a little bit, but having to post it here made me lose my motivation again multiple times today.

The solution: I am going to step away from Reddit for some time. I will try to be back when the new season starts, but I can't promise it. I will still make my posts on my website and link it on twitter, but not on Reddit till I am mentaly more stable again

I am sorry that I have to take that step, but my mental health, and with it my whole live, is more important. But I will try to get back in good shape to be a - hopefully positive - part of the community again.

If you want to find out first about a new post:

​Twitter: ADeadMansName

​ The full list with more details on: Impact - Patch 13.22 - Deadmansplate

Buffs
Rammus jgl
52.4% WR <= Diff: +2.0% <= 50.3% WR

3.0% PR <= +2% PR <= 3.0% PR

Games: 60,522

As expected, the buff of +10 Armor to the W was too large. He is still a niche counter pick and gets worse in higher elos, but just +5 Armor would have been enough to get him back in line.

Dr.Mundo top
51.1% WR <= Diff: +1.6% <= 49.5% WR

2.4% PR <= +9% PR <= 2.2% PR

Games: 48,071

His buffs are a bit smaller than Rammus and he was also in a worse spot. He landed really well and has no problems before Diamond.

TwistedFate mid
50.9% WR <= Diff: +1.4% <= 49.5% WR

3.6% PR <= +17% PR <= 3.1% PR

Games: 71,474

His buff may seem small but it is a ~18% faster windup for the AA, meaning he stands still ~82 of the time compared to before. That is massive when it comes to kiting. But his WRrise also has a 2nd reason. More people get Ludens and Lich Bane compared to before.

Gragas jgl
47.9% WR <= Diff: +1.0% <= 46.9% WR

2.3% PR <= +8% PR <= 2.1% PR

Games: 46,313

The new E CDR is a way better mechanic for him. He is on the edge of being viable in the jungle again, at least with AP.

Heimerdinger sup
50.4% WR <= Diff: +0.9% <= 49.5% WR

1.2% PR <= +8% PR <= 1.1% PR

Games: 23,360

Annie mid
51.5% WR <= Diff: +0.8% <= 50.7% WR

1.2% PR <= +6% PR <= 1.2% PR

Games: 24,688

Neeko sup
49.9% WR <= Diff: +0.8% <= 49.1% WR

2.4% PR <= +2% PR <= 2.4% PR

Games: 47,699

Singed top
53.1% WR <= Diff: +0.7% <= 52.3% WR

1.8% PR <= +6% PR <= 1.7% PR

Games: 35,956

LeBlanc mid
47.7% WR <= Diff: +0.7% <= 46.9% WR

3.6% PR <= +4% PR <= 3.4% PR

Games: 71,642

A nice little buiff to her. AD builds are still terrible, so pls stop boing for it.

Xerath sup, mid
51.7% WR <= Diff: +0.8% <= 50.9% WR

6.3% PR <= -0% PR <= 6.3% PR

Games: 124,301

A tiny buff to Xerath support.

52.3% WR <= Diff: +0.6% <= 51.7% WR

3.5% PR <= +7% PR <= 3.3% PR

Games: 70,128

A decent buff to Xerath mid. CSing and AAing is a lot smoother. He doesn't use it as much as TF, so it doesn't impact him a ton, but it is meaningful

Brand sup, jgl, mid
50.3% WR <= Diff: +0.6% <= 49.7% WR

4.0% PR <= +8% PR <= 3.7% PR

Games: 79,556

Support Brand is still ok, but mid slowly takes over.

49.8% WR <= Diff: +1.6% <= 48.2% WR

2.0% PR <= +27% PR <= 1.6% PR

Games: 40,601

Still not really a thing.

50.9% WR <= Diff: +0.7% <= 50.2% WR

1.2% PR <= +27% PR <= 0.9% PR

Games: 23,160

Brand mid is starting to look like the better Brand.

Nerfs
TahmKench top, bot, sup
50.2% WR <= Diff: -2.2% <= 52.4% WR

3.5% PR <= -21% PR <= 4.4% PR

A melee mage toplaner
I've been playing League for a bout 1,5 years and my favorite role as you can probably guess is top, but my favorite character class is mage, specifically battle mages like Swain. What I like about top is that you are both 1v1 melee bruisers and that why i don't want to switch roles to mid or jungle.

What I consider a mage is a character witch has almost none or none movement abilities and does almost all it's damage with abilities so I don't think Kennen is really a mage for top, because he has way to much movement so I think this mage should have a few criteria if Riot ever desides to add a top mage like this

melee but still do a lot of damage with abilities;

a pretty tanky or drain tanky champion that can survive Darius and Garen;

someone who has really good scaling, but has an alternative resourse kind of like Aphelios but with spells and instead of mana, because all mages currently have mana issues in toplane;

and i think he could be a mage that has a sword or dagger and a book or staff, kind of dual wielding it because this should be a melee mage.

I really want to know am I the only one who want's a champion like this or are there more people like me who like to play top and mages

When will the Heartsteel bundles be removed?
Hi! Sorry if this is perhaps stated somewhere in the game, but does anyone know when the Heartsteel bundles will be removed? Like the ones with the borders and icons? I wanna get one for someone's birthday and I don't know if they'll still be available. Thank you! :)

Any watch parties for the world finals in Atlanta?
I would love to watch the finals with a group of people to share in the (hopefully) hype games this Saturday night (Sunday am). I don’t really know any league players in the area. I was hoping to find a bar or something that would stay open all night to show it, but I haven’t had any luck. If this isn’t the best place to ask, please direct me to a better one!

First post... who is a relatively easy assassin type player to play?
So I'm generally in the Plat 2 to Plat 4 range, but I only really play mages or tanks in mid/top or support. I have a bronze account that I use to play with lower rated friends. Who is an assassin type player that I should try that doesn't have a really big learning curve. I was thinking maybe Yone or Naafiri although she may not be considered a real assassin. Any thoughts? Thanks in advance for the suggestions!

Should the penalty for trolling be more severe and immediate?
Context : I’m Silver 1 Also context: I am trying to win cause losing sucks.

In the 9 games that I’ve played in the last 3 days, 3 of them have had unplayable trolls on my team. First, a Syndra support that took smite and her grab ability at lvl 1. She followed our jungled around and would grab the camp/ buff from him and pull it away so it constantly resets. Other two are players that decide that they hate winning and actively go down the lane to enemy tower and players and die on purpose dozens of times.

Additionally, after looking up these players on op.gg, THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS ALL WEEK IN AT LEAST 6 GAMES.

This makes my experience of the game so so so poor that I want justice. And big justice. Like permanent justice. Like -11000202828 lp justice. LIKE PERMA BAN JUSTICE.

Thoughts?

My main issue with Nexus Blitz
I enjoy Nexus Blitz and have played about 20 games this year, however I thought every game felt like a stomp and, sure enough, in 19/22 ( win 12/22) games the game ended between 11-13 minutes with only 2 games getting to the walking nexus point. In 1 game the team that was massively behind won the final challenge and then the game. I understand it's meant to be a fast and fun game mode, however it's still frustrating when the enemy team is so much better than yours and ending a game in 11 minutes doesn't feel satisfying either.

I'm of course not suggesting ranked play, but is there any way Riot could improve matchmaking a bit?

Quick Play is already devolving
Been trying out the new quickplay mode as I remember a time many years ago where they had something similar where you could pre-pick your champion before queuing up (forget the name of it).

While I really want this mode to be functional, people are already making it unfun and unplayable.

In the same game I had:

Xayah support who didn't get a support item, played the game as if they were ADC, forced the real ADC to AFK and then refused to ff the 4 vs 5.

Lux jungle who did not have smite (which seems insane that this would even be allowed). She got a support item but tried to duo mid and then just roam around the map. Also refused to ff the 4 vs 5.

Neither of these two players typed anything during the game, no pings, no communication at all.

I get being frustrated with your teammates in game. I get (to a much lesser extent) being frustrated with your teammates in champ select.

But signing up to join a game with no fore-knowledge of your teammates to a mode where you can absolutely play your desired champ and role, and then play in a way that will not only guarantee a loss, but make it crazy unfun for your teammates is something I really don't understand. Even if it's a  haha, gottem so mad he made a reddit post . Congrats? You held us hostage for 30 minutes for the lolz.

Our community is small. Like really small. But for some reason the goal is to alienate each other to a point where we actively walk away from the game.

Can I say something controversial? I LIKE THE GAME. I like the champions, the buttons, the improvement curve, the frequent patching, the map, the strategy, etc. And I've had great fun playing with teammates who are trying to win. Wombo combos. Invades. Skirmishing over vision. Stealing barons. Backdoor splitpushing. All that stuff is great. I'm not sure why there is a large chunk (large enough that it can feel like every game) of players who are so quick to anger. So quick to be mean and ferocious to someone else over a miscommunication on a gank. A top laner who dies twice before I can get 2 buffs that just spam pings me and afks. A jungler who tilts and rages because you got last hit on scuttle crab 30 minutes into the game. An ADC who will actively die repeatedly if you have the audacity to accidently last hit a caster minion. A support who forgets to get a sweeper when their item evolves and then refuses to get one out of spite when you remind them. And of course, the main character mid where any assist they get is considered a kill stolen.

I just think we all need to calm down a bit. Some of the rhetoric in the scene has trickled down in an unhealthy way. When streamers see that a top laner is up 10 cs at 10 minutes and declare the game over. When someone misses a skillshot and are considered inting. The expectations of your teammates is too high (almost certainly too high for whatever ELO you are in) and expecting/demanding perfect play that aligns with how you see the game is not possible. So stop being so mad about it.

I didn't mean for this to turn into a whole rant, but here we are...

Challenge  X% of players earned  text is misleading?
https://i.imgur.com/HpNYAVV.png

Challenger have not  earned  the Grand Master token (anymore). Is this a bug, or intended?

The expectation is that Challenger token holders would have earned all ranks below, but it appears it only shows who exactly has the token at that rank.

Notice how the GM Challenge has a lower % of people that earned it, than the Challenger rank, which doesn't make sense given intuition.

Make Quickplay switch your MR/Armor runes depending on matchup.
This is only the biggest issue with Quickplay right now, since matchups are random, we are either forced to go HP or flip that the matchup we go is the same as our defensive stat.

Hello, I recently picked up league of legends as it looked like a fun game to play. What heroes are easiest to learn and are also good in the highest ranks? I prefer to be the damage dealer and have strong early game and am unsure who to buy first.

@Midnoflash(kr reporter): I will support Faker all my life. He is the first person to say hello to me.
Midnoflash is a Korean reporter. He posted on his twitter:

 The reason why I will support Faker forever is because he is the first player to say hello to me first.

I started following e-sports news in 2017. For a long time, even if I met the players in the arena, I never said hello once. There were also things that happened that made me feel embarrassed. Even though they have met several times in the media room, it is not easy for professional players to remember the faces and names of unfamiliar reporters.

One day I met the SKT players at the OGN arena. For the first time, player Faker said hello to me and then nodded to me. By then he was already a star among stars. The SKT players who were with him also nodded and said hello to me. This is the first time I have said hello to the players since I entered the e-sports industry.

They probably don't remember that moment...but it was a very precious moment to me. It felt like it was the first time that I was recognized as an industry insider from an outsider. I felt very gratified and excited for some reason, and I still have a vivid memory.

At that time, Faker probably didn't know who I was. He just greeted me like he always did because he met the staff. (When he comes to the media room now, he will never forget to say hello to us.) This is the first time I have been recognized by others since I started this job, and I am very grateful. Since then, I have always been grateful to him.

Fyi, the first person to recognize and greet me outside the stadium was kuro but he probably won't remember that either

SPOILER
Facing a winner from every Worlds since 2017

Ver spoiler
This World Championship had a winner from every Worlds since 2016. Apart from Damwon players who fell in Swiss Stage, Faker had to face all of them.

Year	Player	Previous Winning Team	Current Team	Last match with T1
2016	Faker	T1	T1	-
2017	Ruler	SG	JDG	Worlds Semis
2017	CoreJJ	SG	TL	Worlds Swiss
2018	TheShy	IG	WBG	Worlds Finals
2019	Crisp	FPX	WBG	Worlds Finals
2020	Canyon	Damwon	Damwon	LCK Playoffs
2020	Showmaker	Damwon	Damwon	LCK Playoffs
2021	Scout	EDG	LNG	Worlds Quarters
2022	Pyosik	DRX	TL	Worlds Swiss
2022	Deft	DRX	Damwon	LCK Playoffs
All roads lead to Faker, but this is Faker's road.

If T1 win this year, there’s your script for the 2024 Worlds Song Video!

Did my first ever placements
So i did my first ever placements in an account where i only played bots until level 30, yeah i know it's sad but i'm not that really high rank (just gold) for my smurf to do something to impact a lot low rank games, i just did a game with a friend wich we loss and i did pretty poorly actually, but he is ironand i never played ranked on the account and we got golds and plat ranked just to start the disgrace, after we loss i got placed gold 4...

Wich is even higher than my main, and made all my level 30 grind useless since i couldnt play with him anyway, how is it possible a recent level 30 account got instantly level 30 after the first placement match

The best off meta pick in low elo (in my opinion)
Hey, fellow summoners! I've got a hot take that's been brewing in the depths of low ELO, and trust me, it's a game-changer. Forget about those so-called  meta  picks; the key to climbing out of Bronze is none other than Teemo Jungle.

I know what you're thinking – Teemo Jungle? But hear me out. Teemo's passive allows him to go undetected in the jungle, setting up those perfect surprise ganks that low ELO players won't see coming. Picture this: you're casually farming Raptors when suddenly a wild Teemo appears, blinds you, and secures an unexpected kill. It's genius, really.

Now, Teemo's Q is the ultimate tool for tilting the enemy jungler. Imagine invading their jungle, blinding them, stealing their buffs, and disappearing into the shrooms-infested abyss. It's a psychological warfare that low ELO players just can't handle.

But the real deal is Teemo's ultimate. Low ELO players tend to forget about vision, so dropping shrooms everywhere not only provides map control but also sets up the perfect trap for unsuspecting enemies. I've lost count of how many times I've seen opponents mindlessly walk into a shroom-infested river, only to meet their demise.

Now, I get it – Teemo Jungle might not be the most conventional pick, and your teammates might flame you in chat. But trust me, once they witness the terror of Teemo's surprise ganks and the shroom minefield he creates, they'll be singing a different tune.

So, the next time you're in champion select and your teammates are begging you not to pick Teemo Jungle, ignore them. Embrace the Bronze special, channel your inner Teemo, and watch as the enemy team falls victim to the unorthodox brilliance that is Teemo Jungle.

I wish Leona was viable as a top lane tank, or that there was more front line farming tank variety
Tank class in general doesn't have enough variety in it in terms of character types, there's not enough tanks who are ladies or at least who don't look like a big meatball. Most of the tanks like K'sante, Sion, Ornn, and Malphite, etc are just this very similar shape, I want more tanks that don't have super similar silhouettes. A knight-in-armor sword and shield frontline tank is somehow an underrepresented archetype in this game.

Off the top of my head we've only got Rell, Leona, Poppy, and Sejuani for women tanks. Poppy is kinda the only one of the four who is viable in toplane since nobody seems to consider Sejuani top good anymore (if this is still good let me know). Leona is the only one here who is support exclusive and doesn't see any play in a farming role whether that is jungle or elsewhere.

We're probably not getting any new farming tanks for a very long time, K'sante was our first tank since Ornn and before that our last farming tank release was Zac (excluding Rell midscope, Poppy Rework). If they aren't super interested in releasing farming tanks then I'd love it if more of the support tanks like Leona for instance were viable in a farming role also to create a little more variety not only in picks but in visual. As someone who doesn't really jive with K'sante's playstyle, I'd prefer to not have to wait another 5 years for the next tank release.

Recently we also had this push to get some support champs like Brand and Zyra and others into additional roles to give a little additional variety in the game rather than full releasing a whole new champion, and I think Leona is also a good option for similar treatment in toplane.

Do you play early game, mid game, or later game junglers, and why?
I’m curious as to what type of jungler seemingly gets played most, and more importantly, what do you find you love so much about that type of jungler?

Phreak to quit social media due to increase toxicity and death threats
https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxS_sf449KPlYOLMqqRedKleGD4wair8oj?si=vNFPzC52IGZ0b4iC

Phreak mentioned that due to the increase of toxicity and death threats he will be quitting social media.

While I agree with some of the points about the ping system that the community has brought up before, harassing Rioters and others has been happening for so long and has been so severe, that i understand why phreak has come to this decision.

edit: if my inbox rn is anything like phreaks, yalls should be ashamed

Fnatic confirm the departure of Trymbi
Statement below from Fnatic:

https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=846487314144635&set=a.631316562328379

Firstly, we want to thank Trymbi for his efforts in Fnatic, bringing us back to title contention and closely fighting with the World finalists, Weibo. This is not how we would have liked to share the news, but given the recent statements, we’re forced to shed light on this matter.

While we understand and respect the curiosity surrounding recent events, we will not tolerate inaccurate accusations and the resulting hate directed at our staff members.

We pride ourselves on conducting our affairs with transparency and integrity across all titles at Fnatic. We want to clarify that on 25th October we granted permission for Trymbi's agent to explore 2024 LEC opportunities on his behalf, with a clear understanding that a decision on extending his contract had not yet been made.

Our primary focus during Worlds was to ensure our players performed at their best, and we requested a sensitive approach to discussions regarding player contracts. On October 29th, after our elimination from Worlds, Trymbi was given permission to explore options directly.

We did everything in our power to provide both Trymbi and his agent sufficient time to explore opportunities for next year and it was made clear that Trymbi may not be a part of our 2024 roster.

We thank him and wish him well for his break, knowing he will come back stronger in the future. Trymbi’s contribution to Fnatic was vital to us securing our place at Worlds and he deserves to be a part of a top organisation.

Anyone able to shed light on the  inaccurate statements  ?

Results for the coin toss for side selection for the World finals
Weibo have won the coin toss and have selected blue side.

Source: https://twitter.com/AshleyKang/status/1724720617138864230

Yes, it took them the entire media event to flip a coin. And yes, the coin toss was also decided by the dark energies of the head referee.

Also, it feels like WBG needed to win this coin toss, will they ban out Faker's champion pool like some are mentioning?
Will Weibo permaban the J4 as they did vs Xun?
Will Weibo leave the neeko up? Or will T1 permaban it as they did vs Knight and Scout?
What about the Rumble question, can both top laners beat this champion? T1 threw an early gank through smart pathing by Oner to set the Rumble behind, how will Weibo answer?

The draft will be very interesting between these teams.

What are some  off-meta  picks that are actually viable?
Happychimenoises has made a lot of videos about off meta picks like sion invade smite support, pyke mid, yuumi top, etc that reach high elo. Since many players like to stick to the meta rather than find creative ways theirself, I wonder what are some off meta picks, their runes, build, playstyle that makes them playable enough to be considered not troll. (e.g Something like crit nunu or full ap darius is troll)
